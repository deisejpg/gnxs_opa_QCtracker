# gnxs_opa_QCtracker
Extracts relevant metrics from multiple output files obtaining  
after screening FFPE curls the Oncomine Precision Panel on the Genexus.  

Assesses metrics and classify the run as "good," questionable," or "poor."

Assess mutation calls and undergo an internal classification depending on  
the calls present.

Outputs a .xlxs file that is used by the MolBio and Bioinformatics teams  
to keep track of the quality of runs and statistical support for  
mutation calls. Molecular annotation of the cases the FFPE sample belong  
is done after confirming the quality of the sequences with this QC tracker.
